# Plant Application
Full-Stack CRUD App to track plant collection + details (images, last watered and notes)

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: React, JavaScript, Firebase (image upload + storage), CSS, HTML
* Backend: Nodejs, Express, MySQL

## Features
* Create, Read, Update and Delete plant (name, description, last watered, image) to collection
* Search functionality
* Add notes (title, content + date) to individual plants
* RESTful API with NodeJS, Express and MySQL

## Challenges
* Database is curretly for local MySQL - I want to host on heroku but need to figure out where/how to host the database online

## What I learned
* How to organize and name RESTful API
* How to create relational databases in MySQL
* How to upload files to app via Firebase

## Future Improvements
* Add registration and authentication
* Email / Export plant watering schedule to user/friends
